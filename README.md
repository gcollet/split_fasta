split_fasta
===========

This small piece of code splits a fasta file in n fasta files

This is the same implementation as split_fastq available here : https://github.com/gcollet/split_fastq

Usage: ./split_fasta <fasta_file> <nb_files>

example: ./split_fasta full.fasta 3
products three files : full_1.fasta, full_2.fasta, full_3.fasta
